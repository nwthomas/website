## Getting Started

This is the Github repository for my personal website. Making this site gave me the opportunity to really stretch out and craft a site that I felt was mine. It will evolve and grow with time.

## Project Management

I use a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/48bwZhhe/nathans-personal-website) to track work I still need or want to do on this website.
