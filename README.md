# Personal Website

This is my personal website, a place for my writing and thoughts to live.

## Getting Started

First, [install bun](https://bun.com).

Next, clond down this repository and run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

After that, you should be able to go ahead and start up the dev environment server by running:

```bash
make dev
```

It's recommended to set up a `.env` file modeled after the `.env.example` in the root of this repository if you want Sentry functionality, but the basic site will still run without that in place.

## Project Management
