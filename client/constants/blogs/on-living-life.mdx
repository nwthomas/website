## Avoidance and Other Fun Personality Quirks

I think that many of know what we _really_ want deep down inside of ourselves. Now keep in mind that I'm not talking in a concrete sense of "knowing," but rather that abstract and metaphysical way where each of us feels our heart strings pulled in a certain direction when we come across what we really want.

Stay with me for a second. I'm going to make some assumptions about both of our lives, but it will be meaningful by the time we're done (I promise ü§ûüèª).

When you were born into this beautiful world, you started exploring what you liked almost immediately. You probably don't have any memory of this from when you were a baby, but it happened nonetheless. There's a reason kids are known for their sense of wonder.

As time went on, that sense of exploration and wonder got a little squashed. You started picking up the idea that maybe your passion wasn't as cool to other kids/adults as you thought it was, that it might not be the best career path, you were bullied over it, or any other number of things.

Also, you started caring more-and-more about what other people thought of you, that you should make your parents proud, and that failure isn't actually praised by our modern society as much as we claim when we tell people to "follow their dreams."

If any of this (and I mean _any_ of this) sounds familiar or hits home, please keep reading. Let's have a heart-to-heart about what it really means to get back on track and pursue your "good life."

Oh, and grab a nice hot drink. ‚òïÔ∏è

## Plato's Cave, but Make It Too Real

I read recently that many work "shadow jobs." The idea is that these jobs parallel what they _really_ want but are not the same.

I'd even go so far as to say that people live entire "shadow lives" (which is what we'll be discussing today).

For instance, someone who wanted to be a musician might learn to code and go work for an audio production software company. Another person who spent their childhood painting might become a designer. A kid who wanted to solve science for world hunger might end up working in a pharmaceutical lab.

Sometimes these paths in life are dictate by what happens to us. If you have a big family, you'll need to find a way to provide for them, or perhaps your dreams actually did shift over time.

However, many people end up living these parallel lives without realizing it (and for no concrete reason) until the day they die. Many of us are scared of pursuing what we really, _truly_ want in life.

When you go for what your heart actually wants, you run a partial risk of failure. This idea scares a lot of people. They'd rather spend their entire life with the eternal possibility of "what if" instead of running the risk of getting "no" answers. When you're worried that you'll fail, thinking that you could always follow your dreams _someday_ seems much more appealing than actually doing so right now. This way the door is always open.

"After all," people tell themselves, "I'm making pretty good money right now. If I just save a bit more, I'll probably be able to follow my dreams next year." This is exactly what I told myself once, so I get it.

I can already hear you saying, "Thanks for the downer of an article, Nate. Ugh."

If you relate to anything I've said so far in this article, just know you're not alone. Let's shift gears a bit and talk about how to break out of this rut to head towards a life that you want to live.

We'll start by discussing _how_ to figure out what you really want.

## Everything, Everywhere, All at Once

This section is only necessary if you feel like you are struggling to even find direction in life. If this isn't you, skip ahead to the next section.

However, if you're still here with me. Welcome to one of the fun stages of life. I'm going to pull from personal examples of what I went through when I was trying to break into tech.

In his book called "Hell Yeah or No," [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs), founder of [CD Baby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_Baby), writes that many of us miss out on saying "yes" to the opportunities we really want because we're busy with everything we couldn't bring ourselves to say "no" to.

I'd like to take this one step further by saying that many of say "no" to opportunities we'd secretly _love_ to say "yes" to because we're playing it safe.

In short, you should to start saying "yes" to a lot of different opportunities that come your way. Ideally, you'll start pursuing options in multiple areas that you find interesting. It's okay if some (or even a lot) of these decisions don't pan out. That's life and also just a part of the process.

This is actually going to be the most fun proceses you ever go through. Have you seen the movie [Yes Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDh1l3qVNoY)? Think of your life from now on as like that, but with a bit more restraint and the ability to actually say "no" when you're unhappy or uncomfortable.

As you explore, I want you to notice and mentally jot down when you experience something that makes you happy. Perhaps you'll go volunteer at a pet shelter and discover that, while you're not so fond of cleaning up dog üí©, you rather liked when the front-office people were talking to you about their accounting work. Maybe you'll travel to a new city and discover that you enjoyed taking pictures and keeping everyone up to date on your trip while blogging online.

For me, this looked like trying a lot of different hobbies and pasisons out back when I lost my job in healthcare and was searching for a new job. I tried everything, and I randomly discovered one hot summer afternoon in Northern California that I really liked to code. As time went on, I discovered that I _really, really_ liked to code. One thing led to another, and now I have a new career.

No matter what, you'll find that saying "yes" to one door will often open others.

While I can't do this step for you, I can tell you this - Once you have some new ideas gelling in your mind, you're ready to move on to the next step.

Get ready for some major life changes.

## TBD

Okay, those of you who skipped that last section and those who read through it with me are all together now.

One big happy family.

The big secret here is that you _don't_ have to leave your day job just yet (although you can if you really want to), but you don't need to live a shadow life permanently either.

There is another way.

Once you have an inkling of an idea of what your real passions are, I want you to start treating your job (which you'll notice I called your "day job" just above) as just that - it's what you do during the day to temporarily make some money. What you _really_ do and are passionate about is what happens the second you clock out for the day (like a career-minded Batman).

Allow yourself to take some risks while you still have your day job. At every step, refine what you're doing based on feedback you're receiving.

There will come a day where you have to make a decision about if you're going to go all in; if you're even partially certian that you have found what you really enjoy, I want to you grab hold of it with both hands and pursue it with 110% of your energy.

There is no guarantee in life that you'll succeed. In fact, it may take _multiple_ attempts like this in order to find something that works really well for you. However, you will be guaranteed to break the mold on your "shadow life."

You won't need to worry about what-ifs, and that's where our biggest regrets come from.
