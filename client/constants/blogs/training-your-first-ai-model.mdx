# Training Your First AI Model

## Start Your Engine

There's something magical that happens when you manage to get code to do what you want. The itch is almost universal among hackers and coders, and it's why they keep coming back again and again.

When I first got addicted to programming, I loved the fact I could write code that would do exactly what I wanted it to even while I was asleep. For instance, you're reading this and I'm doing something completely different. I love that.

With the recent boom in artificial intelligence, we can take this once step further and create code that will predict, classify, and generate content for us.

A great course you can use to learn about this is one by FastAI called [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/). I'll be summarizing the first few chapters in a condensced format here that should get you up off the ground with your first model trained and deployed for use in no time.

## Get Yourself Some GPUs

The first thing we need to do is sign up for a Kaggle account so that you can have a server and temporary access to GPUs for training your model.

Kaggle is a site that, among other things, allows people like you to participate in competitions for data science/building models; it also will allow you to run code in "notebooks" (more on this in a second) and train models _on its site_ using GPU servers.

Go ahead and head over to [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com) to create a free account. I'll be here when you get back.

Ready?

Awesome. Next, go ahead and hit the `Create` button (which you'll see on the lefthand side if you go to your profile) to create a new notebook. Once you do, you'll see a blank notebook page that looks like this:

Go ahead and give it a new title like "My First AI Model" or "First AI Model" for now.

Okay, let's take a break for a second and talk through what we've done. First off, what is a "notebook" and why do we need it?
