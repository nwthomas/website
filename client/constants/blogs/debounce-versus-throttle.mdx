# Debounce Versus Throttle

> I wrote this article because debounce and throttle are super hard to keep straight and visualize in your head. I hope this will help you in your learning journey.

## Introduction

Back when I was trying to learn the difference between what a `debounce` function (like this one from [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#debounce)) and `throttle` function were (again, here's one from [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#throttle)), it turned out to be annoying to find materials that were crystal clear on _exactly_ how they functioned.

I decided to write an article to correct that for you so you don't suffer the same fate! 😌

The main source of confusion is that, at face value, the two of them seem to behave a bit the same. If you're here reading this, I'm sure you've noticed the same thing.

What we're going to do is take them one at a time and walk through some **real** code examples that will show you exactly what they do (and how they're different).

By the end, you'll be a pro.

Sound good?

Nice. If you want to follow along with live code, check out [this CodeSandbox link](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/debounce-versus-throttle-sandbox-ltxep3?file=%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts&selection=%5B%7B%22endColumn%22%3A1%2C%22endLineNumber%22%3A11%2C%22startColumn%22%3A1%2C%22startLineNumber%22%3A11%7D%5D).

Let's get started.

## Debounce

At it's core, `debounce` is a process for calling a function _exactly_ once for any group of calls (the term `debounce` was [coined by John Hann](http://unscriptable.com/2009/03/20/debouncing-javascript-methods/)).

A `debounce` function is often used when a user does a _lot_ of some sort of action and we only want to act on that when they've finished; a good example of this might be when a user is entering in text into a search input. We don't want to do a search each time they type a character, so we wait until they're done typing before firing off a request for data.

Here's a nifty little diagram that might explain this concept:

<img alt="A cluster of function calls with the words 'Function is repeatedly called' over if with a 250ms wait and then a box symbolizing a funciton call that says 'When the function actually runs'" src="/images/blog/debounce-versus-throttle/debounce.webp" width="852" height="639">

For instance, let's say we have this `debounce` function written in TypeScript:

```typescript
const TIMEOUT_MS = 250;

function debounce(callback: (...args: unknown[]) => unknown) {
  let timeoutId: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | null = null;

  return () => {
    if (timeoutId) {
      clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    }

    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => callback(), TIMEOUT_MS);
  };
}
```

I know, that's a lot to digest. But we're going to walk through it together.

First off, we've defined a variable called `TIMEOUT_MS`. A `debounce` (and also `throttle`) function you'd actually use in a real app would typically allow you to set your _own_ timeout, but we're just hard-coding it here to make things easier. 👍🏻

Next, we have our very own custom `debounce` function. For its parameter, notice that it takes in a `callback` function. We don't know what this function will be, so we've defined it to take in any number of `args` of `unknown` type and returns an `unknown` type (we might want to change this for a production application, but it works for us here):

```typescript
function debounce(callback: (...args: unknown[]) => unknown) {
  // ... code goes here
}
```

This code has more to do with TypeScript than learning about our `debounce` function, so let's move on (although you can read more about TypeScript [here](https://www.nathanthomas.dev/blog/becoming-a-typescript-badass)).

This `callback` function we're taking in as a function parameter is what we're going to `debounce`! Nice, right?

Next, we have this line of code which will track a `timeoutId`:

```typescript
let timeoutId: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | null = null;
```

Don't get too hung up by the TypeScript types here. All this is doing is declaring a `timeoutId` variable, saying it can either by the type of the returned value of a `setTimeout` call (which returns a `number` ID for the timeout) or `null`, and then we initialize the variable to `null`.

The next thing we're going to do is return a function with the guts of our logic:

```typescript
return () => {
  // If we've previously set a timeoutId, that means we've called
  // this function within the timeout time limit
  if (timeoutId) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
  }

  // Whether or not we clear the timeoutId above, set new timeout
  timeoutId = setTimeout(() => callback(), TIMEOUT_MS);
};
```

The first thing it's doing is checking if `timeoutId` is truthy (e.g. not `null`, which was its initial value). If it is, that means our `debounce` has previously been called. We will go ahead and clear the `timeoutId` for reasons that will become apparent in the next few sentences.

Next, we want to call `setTimeout` and assign the return value to `timeoutId`. This `setTimeout` will call `callback` whenever it gets a chance to time out (which should happen after `250` milliseconds which we set earlier as `TIMEOUT_MS`).

_Whew_.

This was a lot.

The TLDR for the code above is that we're clearing our previously-set timeout each time we call our `debounce`-ed function. If we go long enough (`250` milliseconds) without a call to our `debounce-ed` function, we'll finally get a chance to call our `callback` function.

Let's walk through an example of it being used.

First, let's go ahead and set up our `debounce` function:

```typescript
const handleDebouncedLog = debounce(() => console.log("Hello World!"));
```

This passes in a `callback` function into `debounce` and returns an anonymous arrow function as we saw before.

From here, we can write a quick loop to run 100 times and call our `handleDebouncedLog` function each time:

```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  handleDebouncedLog();
}
```

If we were to check the dev console, we'd see _exactly_ one log of "Hello World!" when this code was done running.

This is because we don't allow our timeout to finish when we quickly and repeatedly call our `debounce`-ed function. Each time it's called, it's clearing out the previous `timeoutId` and then setting a new one. It's only allowed to finish at the end when our `250` millisecond `TIMEOUT_MS` time runs out.

Make sense? Nice.

Let's move on to `throttle`.

## Throttle

I have good news for you! If you were able to make it through the `debounce` section with your sanity in tact, you're home free.

The `throttle` function is, by comparison, really easy to grasp. This is because `throttle` merely calls a `callback` function _exactly_ once within a time span (which we'll set using our `TIMEOUT_MS` variable).

If that sounds the same as `debounce`, well... hang with me. Let's discuss it.

A `throttle` fuction is basically saying to a `callback` function it's given, "Hey. You're doing too much. Let's just dial that activity back to one function call every **X** amount of time to tone things down a little bit."

Does that make sense?

Another way of thinking about it is that using `throttle` is like a stoplight that only lets a single car through for every **X** amount of time (even if there are thousands of cars that tried to get through the intersection at the same time).

A picture is worth a thousand words, so here's another one:

<img alt="A cluster of function calls where the function is only allowed to actually run once within the timeout time" src="/images/blog/debounce-versus-throttle/throttle.webp" width="932" height="409">

And, right on schedule, here's a TypeScript example of one of these bad boys:

```typescript
const TIMEOUT_MS = 10;

function throttle(callback: (...args: unknown[]) => unknown) {
  let timeoutId: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | null = null;

  return () => {
    if (timeoutId) {
      return;
    }

    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      callback();
      timeoutId = null;
    }, TIMEOUT_MS);
  };
}
```

The first part of this function is set up exactly like before (our `TIMEOUT_MS` variable, `callback` function parameter, and `timeoutId` variable). We'll skip over those.

I've hard-coded the timeout milliseconds to be `10` this time. That's to reflect the fact that `throttle` is often used to juuuust barely take the edge off some user-initiated action (like moving a mouse or typing into an input) which we want to not run as often.

However, this is where our `throttle` differs from `debounce`. We just return early if we have a `timeoutId` set already inside the anonymous arrow function that we're creating and returning:

```typescript
return () => {
  // This ensures we return if we've previously called the
  // function to kick off the timeout
  if (timeoutId) {
    return;
  }

  // Else, we set the timout which will eventually call our
  // callback and reset timeoutId to null
  timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
    callback();
    timeoutId = null;
  }, TIMEOUT_MS);
};
```

Wait. What? 🤨

I know. It seems a bit off. But what we're essentially doing is building a function that will set a timeout and save a `timeoutId` the first time it runs. Thereafter (until the timeout finishes `10` milliseconds later and calls the `callback`), any further attempts to call our `throttle`-ed function will merely return and not run.

This works like a charm, and it means that we are guaranteed that our `throttle`-ed function will only be called once per `TIMEOUT_MS`.

Once again, let's walk through a quick example of this code in action. First, we create our `throttle`-ed function:

```typescript
const handleThrottledLogger = throttle(() => console.log("Hello World!"));
```

Next, we're going to write a funky little loop that will call this function `20` times.

```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    handleThrottledLogger();
  }, i);
}
```

All this is doing is staggering our calls by `i` milliseconds. We're setting `20` timeouts here (each one staggered by `1` millisecond so they run one after another).

If we were to run this code and check our dev console, we'd see exactly `2` logs of `"Hello World!"`. Can you think of why?

That's right! It's our `throttle` function in action. We're only allowing one function call to get through once every `2` milliseconds.

This is exactly how a `throttle`-ed functions works. It drastically decreases the rate at which the `callback` function inside it can be called.

## Conclusion

Now that you have a great idea of the difference between `debounce` and `throttle`, you can go one step further.

What happens if you want the function call at the _end_ of your `throttle`-ed function to run instead of the _start_ (called the "trailing edge" call rather than the "leading edge" which is what this article talked you through)?

What happens if you're `debounce`-ing a function for user input on a search bar and you want the eventual function call to run with the _newest_ data from the _last_ function call (again, "trailing edge" versus "leading edge")?

These are all possible with code, and I have a sneaking supicion that you'll be able to implement them now!

In any case, I hope this article helped you grasp the differences between these two types of functions.

As always, thanks for reading my articles.
