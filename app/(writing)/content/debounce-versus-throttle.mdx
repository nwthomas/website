## <span id="introduction">Introduction</span>

Back when I was trying to learn the difference between what a `debounce` function (like this one from [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#debounce)) and `throttle` function were (again, here's one from [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#throttle)), it turned out to be annoying to find materials that were crystal clear on _exactly_ how they functioned.

I decided to write an article to correct that for you so you don't suffer the same fate.

The main source of confusion is that, at face value, the two of them seem to behave a bit the same. If you're here reading this, I'm sure you've noticed the same thing.

What we're going to do is take them one at a time and walk through some **real** code examples that will show you exactly what they do (and how they're different).

By the end, you'll be a pro.

Sound good?

Nice. If you want to follow along with live code, check out [this CodeSandbox link](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/debounce-versus-throttle-sandbox-ltxep3?file=%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts&selection=%5B%7B%22endColumn%22%3A1%2C%22endLineNumber%22%3A11%2C%22startColumn%22%3A1%2C%22startLineNumber%22%3A11%7D%5D).

Let's get started.

## <span id="debounce">Debounce</span>

At it's core, `debounce` is a process for calling a function _exactly_ once for any group of calls (the term `debounce` was [coined by John Hann](http://unscriptable.com/2009/03/20/debouncing-javascript-methods/)).

A `debounce` function is often used when a user does a _lot_ of some sort of action and we only want to act on that when they've finished; a good example of this might be when a user is entering in text into a search input. We don't want to do a search each time they type a character, so we wait until they're done typing before firing off a request for data.

Here's a nifty little diagram that might explain this concept:

<Image

For instance, let's say we have this simplified `debounce` function written in TypeScript:

```typescript
const TIMEOUT_MS = 250;

function debounce(callback: (...args: unknown[]) => unknown) {
  let timeoutId: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | null = null;

  return (...args: unknown[]) => {
    if (timeoutId) {
      clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    }

    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => callback(...args), TIMEOUT_MS);
  };
}
```

I know, that's a lot to digest. But we're going to walk through it together.

First off, we've defined a variable called `TIMEOUT_MS`. A `debounce` (and also `throttle`) function you'd actually use in a real app would typically allow you to set your _own_ timeout, but we're just hard-coding it here to make things easier.

Next, we have our very own custom `debounce` function. For its parameter, notice that it takes in a `callback` function. We don't know what this function will be, so we've defined it to take in any number of `args` of `unknown` type and returns an `unknown` type (we might want to change this for a production application, but it works for us here):

```typescript
function debounce(callback: (...args: unknown[]) => unknown) {
  // ... code goes here
}
```

This code has more to do with TypeScript than learning about our `debounce` function, so let's move on (although you can read more about TypeScript [here](https://www.nathanthomas.dev/blog/becoming-a-typescript-badass)).

This `callback` function we're taking in as a function parameter is what we're going to `debounce`! Nice, right?

Next, we have this line of code which will track a `timeoutId`:

```typescript
let timeoutId: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | null = null;
```

Don't get too hung up by the TypeScript types here. All this is doing is declaring a `timeoutId` variable, saying it can either by the type of the returned value of a `setTimeout` call (which returns a `number` ID for the timeout) or `null`, and then we initialize the variable to `null`.

The next thing we're going to do is return a function with the guts of our logic:

```typescript
return (...args: unknown[]) => {
  // If we've previously set a timeoutId, that means we've called
  // this function within the timeout time limit
  if (timeoutId) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
  }

  // Whether or not we clear the timeoutId above, set new timeout
  timeoutId = setTimeout(() => callback(...args), TIMEOUT_MS);
};
```

The first thing it's doing is checking if `timeoutId` is truthy (e.g. not `null`, which was its initial value). If it is, that means our `debounce` has previously been called. We will go ahead and clear the `timeoutId` for reasons that will become apparent in the next few sentences.

Next, we want to call `setTimeout` and assign the return value to `timeoutId`. This `setTimeout` will call `callback` whenever it gets a chance to time out (which should happen after `250` milliseconds which we set earlier as `TIMEOUT_MS`).

_Whew_.

This was a lot.

The TLDR for the code above is that we're clearing our previously-set timeout each time we call our `debounce`-ed function. If we go long enough (`250` milliseconds) without a call to our `debounce-ed` function, we'll finally get a chance to call our `callback` function.

Let's walk through an example of it being used.

First, let's go ahead and set up our `debounce` function:

```typescript
const handleDebouncedLog = debounce(() => console.log("Hello World!"));
```

This passes in a `callback` function into `debounce` and returns an anonymous arrow function as we saw before.

From here, we can write a quick loop to run 100 times and call our `handleDebouncedLog` function each time:

```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  handleDebouncedLog();
}
```

If we were to check the dev console, we'd see _exactly_ one log of "Hello World!" when this code was done running.

This is because we don't allow our timeout to finish when we quickly and repeatedly call our `debounce`-ed function. Each time it's called, it's clearing out the previous `timeoutId` and then setting a new one. It's only allowed to finish at the end when our `250` millisecond `TIMEOUT_MS` time runs out.

Make sense? Nice.

Let's move on to `throttle`.

## <span id="throttle">Throttle</span>

I have good news for you! If you were able to make it through the `debounce` section with your sanity intact, you're home free.

The `throttle` function is, by comparison, really easy to grasp. This is because `throttle` merely calls a `callback` function _exactly_ once within a time span (which we'll set using our `TIMEOUT_MS` variable).

If that sounds the same as `debounce`, well... hang with me. Let's discuss it.

A `throttle` fuction is basically saying to a `callback` function it's given, "Hey. You're doing too much. Let's just dial that activity back to one function call every **X** amount of time to tone things down a little bit."

Does that make sense?

Another way of thinking about it is that using `throttle` is like a stoplight that only lets a single car through for every **X** amount of time (even if there are thousands of cars that tried to get through the intersection at the same time).

A picture is worth a thousand words, so here's another one:

<Image
  alt="A cluster of function calls where the function is only allowed to actually run once within the timeout time"
  src="/images/blog/debounce-versus-throttle/throttle.webp"
  width="932"
  height="419"
/>

And, right on schedule, here's a simplified TypeScript example of one of these bad boys:

```typescript
const TIMEOUT_MS = 10;

function throttle(callback: (...args: unknown[]) => unknown) {
  let timeoutId: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | null = null;

  return (...args: unknown[]) => {
    if (timeoutId) {
      return;
    }

    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      callback(...args);
      timeoutId = null;
    }, TIMEOUT_MS);
  };
}
```

The first part of this function is set up exactly like before (our `TIMEOUT_MS` variable, `callback` function parameter, and `timeoutId` variable). We'll skip over those.

I've hard-coded the timeout milliseconds to be `10` this time. That's to reflect the fact that `throttle` is often used to juuuust barely take the edge off some user-initiated action (like moving a mouse or typing into an input) which we want to not run as often.

However, this is where our `throttle` differs from `debounce`. We just return early if we have a `timeoutId` set already inside the anonymous arrow function that we're creating and returning:

```typescript
return (...args: unknown[]) => {
  // This ensures we return if we've previously called the
  // function to kick off the timeout
  if (timeoutId) {
    return;
  }

  // Else, we set the timout which will eventually call our
  // callback and reset timeoutId to null
  timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
    callback(...args);
    timeoutId = null;
  }, TIMEOUT_MS);
};
```

Wait. What?

I know. It seems a bit off. But what we're essentially doing is building a function that will set a timeout and save a `timeoutId` the first time it runs. Thereafter (until the timeout finishes `10` milliseconds later and calls the `callback`), any further attempts to call our `throttle`-ed function will merely return and not run.

This works like a charm, and it means that we are guaranteed that our `throttle`-ed function will only be called once per `TIMEOUT_MS`.

Once again, let's walk through a quick example of this code in action. First, we create our `throttle`-ed function:

```typescript
const handleThrottledLogger = throttle(() => console.log("Hello World!"));
```

Next, we're going to write a funky little loop that will call this function `20` times.

```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    handleThrottledLogger();
  }, i);
}
```

All this is doing is staggering our calls by `i` milliseconds. We're setting `20` timeouts here (each one staggered by `1` millisecond so they run one after another).

If we were to run this code and check our dev console, we'd see exactly `2` logs of `"Hello World!"`. Can you think of why?

That's right! It's our `throttle` function in action. We're only allowing one function call to get through once every `2` milliseconds.

This is exactly how a `throttle`-ed functions works. It drastically decreases the rate at which the `callback` function inside it can be called.

## <span id="conclusion">Conclusion</span>

Now that you have a great idea of the difference between `debounce` and `throttle`, you can go one step further.

What happens if you want the function call at the _end_ of your `throttle`-ed function to run instead of the _start_ (called the "trailing edge" call rather than the "leading edge" which is what this article talked you through)?

What happens if you're `debounce`-ing a function for user input on a search bar and you want the eventual function call to run with the _newest_ data from the _last_ function call (again, "trailing edge" versus "leading edge")?

These are all possible with code, and I have a sneaking supicion that you'll be able to implement them now!

In any case, I hope this article helped you grasp the differences between these two types of functions.
